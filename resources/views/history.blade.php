             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Dream....... It was a dream for them to put up a school to honor their parents, Mr. Benjamin Buenaventura Domingo Sr. and Mrs. Virgina Pascual Domingo for giving them their education even though they cannot afford it. Their parents sacrificed and faced the hardship of life just to give them the education that they dreamt of.</p>

             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Vision....... In 1996, as they visualized their dreams; they decided to start tutorial classes in their ancestral house with their children, nephews and nieces as their first batch of students. In 1997, with the help of Mr. Almario E. Roxas (deceased), as their Academic and Financial Consultant, they officially opened the school with thirty (30 students from their community and nearest barangays. They built their first two (2) classrooms.)</p>

        	 <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1998, Mrs. Josefina Domingo-Garcia, the School Principal, recognized everything to cope with the standard prescribed by the Department of Education (DepEd) and worked towards a goverment permit and recognition to operate Pre-Elementary,Elementary and Secondary courses. They finally received the Goverment Recognition on June 4, 1999 for Pre-Elementary Course, on November 22, 2002 for Elementary and on March 17, 2003 for Secondary Course. They were also allowed to accept less fortunate students from public schools to get a scholarship grant/subsidy through ESC program.</p>
